# GK AutoHerb - System Architecture, Dashboards, Flows, & Features Document

Welcome to the comprehensive system documentation for **GK AutoHerb**, a state-of-the-art Car Studio Management Platform. This document outlines the role-based dashboard architectures, detailed system feature implementations, step-by-step workflow flowcharts, and the underlying tech stack.

---

## 1. Dashboard Architectures (Role-Based)

The system is designed with a strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model. It divides features into three primary dashboard spaces:

### 1.1 Customer Portal (`/customer`)
An intuitive, responsive interface for vehicle owners to manage profiles, vehicles, active packages, bookings, and live service tracking.
*   **Dashboard Home (`CustomerDashboardPage`)**: 
    *   Visual status cards showing active packages, days remaining (real-time countdown), remaining service credits (washes, wax, etc.), and accumulated loyalty rewards/points.
    *   Quick links for Booking a Service, Buying Packages, and Vehicle Management.
*   **Vehicle Management (`VehiclesPage`)**: 
    *   Allows adding/editing vehicles with Brand, Model, Reg Number, and Registration Year (via dynamic dropdown 1990–Current).
*   **Booking Engine (`BookingPage`)**: 
    *   Step-by-step flow: Select Vehicle → Check package credit availability vs. cash booking → Select Slot (with real-time availability indicator) → Select Services (with dynamic duration badges) → Pay Advance (if required by settings) → Confirm.
*   **Booking History & Changes (`BookingsPage`)**: 
    *   Tracks pending, confirmed, completed, and cancelled bookings.
    *   Provides a **Change Service** button (active up to 24 hours prior to slot time) enabling customers to modify/swap services.
*   **Live Service Tracking (`TrackingPage`)**: 
    *   Real-time status updates powered by WebSockets (Socket.io) showing the progress of their car: `Check-in` → `Inspection` → `Washing` → `Polishing` → `Quality Check` → `Ready for Delivery`.
*   **Loyalty & Rewards (`LoyaltyPage`)**: 
    *   Displays referral code, wallet balance, and transactional logs of points earned/redeemed. Button to share code/referral link via WhatsApp.

---

### 1.2 Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
An extensive control hub for administrators to oversee workshop operations, slot schedules, inventory, payroll, invoicing, and accounts.
*   **Overview & Analytics (`DashboardPage`)**: 
    *   Displays today's booked slots vs. capacity (utilization progress bars), active staff count, pending package approvals, low-stock inventory alerts, and revenue counters.
*   **Job Cart Operations (`JobCartListPage`, `JobCartCreatePage`, `JobCartDetailPage`)**: 
    *   Master tool for vehicle servicing: opens new job carts, documents initial condition (fuel, scratch maps), allocates parts/labor, updates tracking stage, calculates totals, and completes jobs.
*   **Customer & Vehicles Directory (`CustomersListPage`, `CustomerDetailPage`)**: 
    *   360-degree profile of each customer displaying details, associated vehicles, past packages, invoice history, and package credit adjustments.
*   **Slot & Capacity Management (`SlotsPage`)**: 
    *   Manage calendar slots, block dates (e.g., maintenance/holidays), configure capacity, and book offline walk-ins.
*   **Package Management & Approvals (`PackagesPage`, `PackageApprovalsPage`, `PackagesTrackingPage`)**: 
    *   Catalog setup for standard packages (Bronze, Silver, Gold, etc.).
    *   Approval queue for package requests (Razorpay online or Manual Cash verification).
    *   **Custom Package Module**: Ability to create bespoke, hidden packages for VIP customers, specifying custom service quantities and validity.
*   **Accounts & Balance Sheets (`AccountsPage`, `BalanceSheetPage`, `PaymentsPage`, `AllInvoicesPage`)**: 
    *   Sales invoices (GST tax compliance), purchase invoices, GSTR reports, and real-time Profit & Loss balance sheet calculations.
*   **Quick Wash Queue (`QuickWashPage`)**: 
    *   Fast-track dashboard for express washing. Tracks sub-phases (`Pre-wash` → `Foam Wash` → `Rinse` → `Vacuum` → `Dry & Polish`).
*   **Staff, Salaries, & HR (`StaffPage`, `StaffHRPage`, `StaffSalaryPage`, `StaffDetailPage`)**: 
    *   Technician task assignment, daily attendance logs (clock in/out), leave approvals, role selection, and monthly salary processing based on working days and overtime.

---

### 1.3 Staff Portal (`/staff`)
A mobile-friendly, streamlined panel restricted to technicians and washers to view tasks and update active service details without financial visibility.
*   **Today's Task Queue (`StaffJobCartsPage`)**: 
    *   Lists only the job carts scheduled for the current day. Financial values (service/parts prices) are hidden.
*   **New Entry Creation**: 
    *   Create job carts for today's walk-ins or add Quick Wash queue entries.
*   **Quick Wash Stepper**: 
    *   Staff can advance express washes through phases (`Pre-wash` → `Foam` → `Rinse` → `Vacuum` → `Dry` → `Complete`).
*   **Benefits & Salary Advances (`StaffBenefitsPage`)**: 
    *   Enables staff to check their processed payroll slips, incentives, and leave balances.
*   **Check In / Check Out**: 
    *   Clock attendance at the start/end of the shift.
